# Keyboard Layout Extractor

A C# utility for extracting and exporting Windows keyboard layouts to multiple formats, including QMK-compatible header files. This tool helps keyboard firmware developers and enthusiasts to accurately replicate Windows keyboard layouts in their custom keyboard projects.

## Features

- üîç Extracts keyboard layouts directly from Windows Registry
- üó∫Ô∏è Maps virtual keys and character combinations
- ‚ö° Identifies and exports dead key configurations
- üíæ Exports layouts in multiple formats:
  - JSON format for further processing
  - QMK-compatible header files for firmware development
- ‚å®Ô∏è Supports all installed keyboard layouts
- üîÑ Handles shift states and special characters

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework (compatible with the C# version you're using)
- Administrative privileges (for registry access)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE
3. Build the project


## Usage

1. Run the executable:
```bash
KeyboardLayoutExtractor.exe
```

2. The program will automatically:
   - Scan your system for installed keyboard layouts
   - Extract layout information
   - Generate files in the `exported_layouts` directory

### Output Files

The tool generates two types of files for each keyboard layout:

1. `{LayoutId}.json` - Contains complete layout data including:
   - Layout identification information
   - Virtual key mappings
   - Character mappings
   - Dead keys list

2. `keymap_{layoutid}.h` - QMK-compatible header file containing:
   - Layout definitions
   - Virtual key mappings
   - Dead key definitions

## Technical Details

### Key Components

- Uses Windows API (user32.dll) for keyboard layout interaction
- Registry access for layout enumeration
- Virtual key mapping and character code conversion
- Dead key detection and processing

### API Functions Used

- `GetKeyboardLayoutList`
- `LoadKeyboardLayout`
- `VkKeyScanEx`
- `MapVirtualKeyEx`
- `ToUnicodeEx`
